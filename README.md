📌 Project Title

Employee Productivity Prediction System Using Machine Learning and Flask 

📄 Project Description

The Employee Productivity Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to analyze workplace and operational factors to predict the productivity level of employees. This system helps organizations gain data-driven insights into workforce performance and supports better decision-making for productivity improvement.

The application is built using Python, Flask, and XGBoost, where a trained machine learning model predicts employee productivity based on various parameters such as department, working day, team number, targeted productivity, overtime, idle time, number of workers, and work-in-progress (WIP).

A user-friendly web interface allows users to input employee and work-related details through an online form. These inputs are processed using the same encoding and preprocessing techniques applied during model training to ensure accurate predictions. The trained XGBoost model then classifies the productivity level as Average, Medium, or High, which is displayed instantly on the results page.

The system follows a modular and scalable architecture, making it suitable for real-world deployment in manufacturing units, garment industries, and corporate environments where productivity monitoring is critical.

This screen shows the prediction input form where users enter employee and work-related details required by the machine learning model.
The form includes fields such as quarter, department, day, team number, targeted productivity, SMV, WIP, overtime, incentive, idle time, idle men, number of style changes, and number of workers.
Dropdowns are used for categorical inputs like department and day to reduce input errors.
This page acts as the primary interface for user interaction with the ML model.

🖼️ Screenshot 2: Prediction Result Page (/submit)

This screen displays the prediction result generated by the XGBoost model after form submission.
Based on the input data, the model predicts the productivity score and classifies it into categories such as Average, Medium, or Highly Productive.
In this example, the system predicts “The employee is highly productive.”
The page also provides navigation back to the home page for repeated predictions.

🖼️ Screenshot 3: Home Page – Performance Evaluation

This is the home page of the application, introducing the concept of employee productivity evaluation.
It explains why productivity analysis is important for organizational success and how employee performance impacts overall business growth.
The navigation bar allows users to move easily between Home, About, and Predict pages.
This page gives users a contextual understanding of the problem domain.
