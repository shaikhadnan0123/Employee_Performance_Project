📌 Project Title

Employee Productivity Prediction System Using Machine Learning and Flask http://127.0.0.1:5000

📄 Project Description

The Employee Productivity Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to analyze workplace and operational factors to predict the productivity level of employees. This system helps organizations gain data-driven insights into workforce performance and supports better decision-making for productivity improvement.

The application is built using Python, Flask, and XGBoost, where a trained machine learning model predicts employee productivity based on various parameters such as department, working day, team number, targeted productivity, overtime, idle time, number of workers, and work-in-progress (WIP).

A user-friendly web interface allows users to input employee and work-related details through an online form. These inputs are processed using the same encoding and preprocessing techniques applied during model training to ensure accurate predictions. The trained XGBoost model then classifies the productivity level as Average, Medium, or High, which is displayed instantly on the results page.

The system follows a modular and scalable architecture, making it suitable for real-world deployment in manufacturing units, garment industries, and corporate environments where productivity monitoring is critical.
